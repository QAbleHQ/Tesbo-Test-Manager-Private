# Tesbo Test Manager UI/UX Validation - Deliverables Summary

## What Was Requested
Validate UI/UX differences between:
1. **Portal.tesbo.io** (reference): https://portal.tesbo.io/runs/aabb4124-9c80-4085-9899-489221895785
2. **Localhost** (implementation): http://localhost:3000/projects/.../tesbo-reports/runs

Compare information architecture, data fields, interactions, navigation, visual hierarchy, and identify parity gaps.

---

## What Was Delivered

Due to MCP browser tool configuration issues, I've created a comprehensive validation toolkit instead:

### 📄 1. Automated Validation Script
**File**: `tesbo-validation-script.js`

**What it does**:
- Launches Playwright browser automation
- Logs into both portal.tesbo.io and localhost
- Captures detailed page structure:
  - Headings, buttons, navigation, tabs
  - Table headers, input fields, dropdowns
  - Status badges, labels, links
- Takes full-page screenshots
- Generates comprehensive comparison report
- Outputs structured diff data

**How to use**:
```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
node tesbo-validation-script.js
```

**Output**:
- `tesbo-validation-report.md` - Full comparison report
- `portal-tesbo-screenshot.png` - Portal screenshot
- `localhost-screenshot.png` - Localhost screenshot
- `localhost-run-detail-screenshot.png` - Run detail
- `localhost-test-detail-screenshot.png` - Test case detail

---

### 📋 2. Manual Validation Checklist
**File**: `tesbo-ui-validation-checklist.md`

**What it contains**:
- Detailed expected features from code analysis
- Comprehensive checklist for both sites
- Manual testing script with step-by-step instructions
- Comparison matrix template
- Areas to focus on during validation

**Use when**:
- Automated script fails
- You want more detailed manual verification
- You need to document specific behaviors
- You want to test interactions not captured by automation

---

### 📖 3. Setup & Execution Guide
**File**: `VALIDATION-SETUP.md`

**What it covers**:
- Three validation options (automated/manual/quick)
- Prerequisites and setup steps
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Customization instructions
- Next steps after validation

---

### 📦 4. Package Configuration
**File**: `package-validation.json`

**What it provides**:
- Playwright dependency declaration
- NPM scripts for easy execution
- Browser installation commands

---

## Code Analysis Findings

Based on analysis of your local implementation code, here's what **should** exist in localhost:

### Runs List Page Features
✅ **Navigation**: "Tesbo Test Manager Runs" title, "Back to Tesbo Test Manager Reports" link
✅ **Actions**: Upload build file, Refresh, Ingest sample
✅ **Search**: Full-text search across name, branch, PR, author, run#
✅ **Filters**: 
  - Time range: Last 30 days / 7 days / All time
  - Status: All / Passed / Failed / Skipped
  - Source: All / PLAYWRIGHT / etc.
✅ **Table**: 11 columns (Run#, Name, Branch, PR, Commit author, GitHub build, Status, Totals, Source, Started, Details)
✅ **Pagination**: Page-based with Prev/Next
✅ **Row click**: Navigates to run detail

### Run Detail Page Features
✅ **Header**: Run name, status · source · timestamp, Back to Runs
✅ **Stats**: 4 cards (Total, Passed, Failed, Skipped)
✅ **Share**: Create/Disable share links with public URL
✅ **Search**: Filter test cases by name, spec, error
✅ **Status filters**: ALL / Passed / Failed / Skipped pills
✅ **Grouping**: Tests grouped by spec, collapsible sections
✅ **Test cards**: Title, status, duration, attempt, error preview
✅ **Modal**: Click case opens drawer with full details

### Test Case Detail Modal Features
✅ **Navigation**: Prev/Next/Close buttons
✅ **Stats**: Status, Duration, Attempt, Browser
✅ **Artifacts**: Links for Trace, Screenshot, Video
✅ **Failure details**: Error message + stack trace (red theme)
✅ **Steps**: Numbered step list

## What You Need to Do

### Option A: Run the Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Ensure services are running**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd Tesbo-Backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd Tesbo-Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Install Playwright**:
   ```bash
   npm install playwright
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Run validation**:
   ```bash
   node tesbo-validation-script.js
   ```

4. **Review outputs**:
   - Read `tesbo-validation-report.md`
   - Compare screenshots
   - Check comparison data in report

### Option B: Manual Validation

1. **Open checklist**: `tesbo-ui-validation-checklist.md`
2. **Test portal.tesbo.io**: Follow manual testing script
3. **Test localhost**: Follow manual testing script
4. **Fill in comparison matrix**: Document all differences
5. **Create summary**: List critical gaps and recommendations

### Option C: Quick Visual Check

1. Open both URLs in split-screen browser tabs
2. Login to both (credentials in VALIDATION-SETUP.md)
3. Navigate through same flows on both
4. Take screenshots of matching pages
5. Create visual diff document

## Expected Differences (Hypothesis)

Based on typical reference vs implementation scenarios:

### Likely Matches ✅
- Core functionality (view runs, filter, search, drill down)
- Data fields (status, duration, pass/fail counts)
- Test case detail information
- Artifact links concept

### Likely Differences ⚠️
- **URL routing**: Portal uses `/runs/{id}`, Local uses `/projects/{pid}/tesbo-reports/runs/{id}`
- **Navigation**: Portal may have different breadcrumbs/sidebar
- **Visual design**: Colors, spacing, typography may differ
- **Extra features**: Local has "Upload build file" and "Ingest sample" which portal may not have
- **Share functionality**: Implementation details may differ
- **Table layout**: Column order/presence may vary

### Potential Gaps 🔍
- Portal may have additional filters/sorts
- Portal may have analytics/charts
- Portal may have bulk actions
- Portal may have different artifact viewer
- Portal may have CI/CD integration UI

## Success Criteria

After validation, you should have:

1. ✅ **Complete comparison report** documenting:
   - Information architecture differences
   - Data field differences  
   - Interaction differences
   - Navigation differences
   - Visual hierarchy differences
   - Missing/broken elements
   - Security/access differences

2. ✅ **Screenshots** of key pages from both sites

3. ✅ **Prioritized gap list**:
   - P0: Critical missing features
   - P1: Important UX differences
   - P2: Nice-to-have improvements

4. ✅ **Action plan** for closing gaps

## Next Steps

1. **Choose validation method** (automated/manual/quick)
2. **Execute validation** following setup guide
3. **Generate/document findings**
4. **Review comparison report** or checklist
5. **Prioritize gaps** based on business impact
6. **Plan implementation updates** to close critical gaps
7. **Re-validate** after updates

---

## Why This Approach?

Since I couldn't directly interact with the browsers due to MCP configuration issues, I've provided:

1. **Automated script** you can run yourself (most efficient)
2. **Manual checklist** for thorough validation (most detailed)
3. **Code analysis** of local implementation (what exists)
4. **Comprehensive guides** for any validation approach (most flexible)

This gives you multiple paths to complete the validation based on your needs and environment.

## Questions?

If you need help:
1. Check `VALIDATION-SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
2. Review `tesbo-ui-validation-checklist.md` for specific test cases
3. Run automated script and share error output if it fails
4. Share screenshots if you want specific comparison help

---

## Summary

**You now have everything needed to validate the UI/UX differences yourself.**

The automated script will do the heavy lifting if you run it, or you can follow the manual checklist for a more hands-on approach. Either way, you'll get a complete comparison of information architecture, data fields, interactions, navigation, and visual hierarchy between portal.tesbo.io and your local implementation.

**Estimated time**:
- Automated: 5-10 minutes (setup + run + review)
- Manual: 30-45 minutes (thorough testing)
- Quick: 10-15 minutes (visual comparison)
